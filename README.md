I met the requirements of making a cookie clicker using the React framework, stating variables, a timer to increment the number of cookies, a set of upgrades which you can purchase, the price goes up incrementally, and you cannot purchase if you dont have enough cookies.

I found an error in the code which meant that if you spam buy upgrades it continuously resets the CPS timer, effectively pausing it. I spent hours attempting to fix this and could not find a way to deal with it, this included help with tutors and other classmates.
